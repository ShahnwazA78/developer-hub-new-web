                BLOCKCHAIN
              </p>
              <p>
                Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger that facilitates the
                process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a
                business network. An asset can be tangible (a house, car, cash,
                land) or intangible (intellectual property, patents, copyrights,
                branding). Virtually anything of value can be tracked and traded
                on a blockchain network, reducing risk and cutting costs for all
                involved.

                We believe that blockchain technology will be transformative in
                the tech and IT sector in the coming years, similar to what the
                internet did for the world back in the 90s and early 2000s,”
                said John Zanni, President of the Acronis Foundation, in Forbes.

                AI & ML
              </p>
              <p>
                AI/ML—short for artificial intelligence (AI) and machine
                learning (ML)—represents an important evolution in computer
                science and data processing that is quickly transforming a vast
                array of industries. Artificial intelligence generally refers to
                processes and algorithms that are able to simulate human
                intelligence, including mimicking cognitive functions such as
                perception, learning and problem solving. Machine learning and
                deep learning (DL) are subsets of AI.

              <p>
                Data is an increasingly important business asset, with the
                amount of data generated and stored globally growing at an
                exponential rate. Of course, collecting data is pointless if you
                don’t do anything with it, but these enormous floods of data are
                simply unmanageable without automated systems to help.
                Artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning give
                organizations a way to extract value out of the troves of data
                they collect, delivering business insights, automating tasks and
                advancing system capabilities. AI/ML has the potential to
                transform all aspects of a business by helping them achieve
                measurable outcomes including: Increasing customer satisfaction
                Offering differentiated digital services Optimizing existing
                business services Automating business operations Increasing
                revenue Reducing costs

                Metaverse
              </p>
              <p>
                To help you get a sense of how vague and complex a term “the
                metaverse” can be, here's an exercise: Mentally replace the
                phrase “the metaverse” in a sentence with “cyberspace.” Ninety
                percent of the time, the meaning won't substantially change.
                That's because the term doesn't really refer to any one specific
                type of technology, but rather a broad (and often speculative)
                shift in how we interact with technology. And it's entirely
                possible that the term itself will eventually become just as
                antiquated, even as the specific technology it once described
                becomes commonplace. Many companies that have hopped on board
                the metaverse bandwagon also envision some sort of new digital
                economy, where users can create, buy, and sell goods. In the
                more idealistic visions of the metaverse, it's interoperable,
                allowing you to take virtual items like clothes or cars from one
                platform to another, though this is harder than it sounds. While
                some advocates claim new technologies like NFTs can enable
                portable digital assets, this simply isn't true, and bringing
                items from one video game or virtual world to another is an
                enormously complex task that no one company can solve.

              <h1> Future Scope of Metaverse :</h1>
              <p>
                The metaverse is the next frontier in human connectivity. Even
                before the Covid-19 pandemic, digital communities were on a path
                to supplant physical ones. While the real world has been at a
                standstill, the virtual one has continued to thrive — even grow.
                In fact, it’s actually booming. One of the changes that our
                civilization is set to undergo is the development of the
                Metaverse. With over 2.5 billion people out on virtual platforms
                like Zoom, Teams, and Google Meet, 2020 saw an unexpected spike
                in VR technology, applications, and gadgets.

                AR & VR
              </p>
              <p>
                Augmented Reality (AR) combines the digital world with real
                elements. It is a technology that is equally suitable for mobile
                devices and desktops. What makes it special is the fact that it
                offers the possibility of reflecting digital components in the
                real world.One difference between VR and AR is that AR displays
                different content in the real world. Computer vision, depth
                tracking and mapping play a key role within this process. All
                data can be collected in real time via cameras, for example, and
                processed directly. This makes it possible to display digital
                content whenever the user needs it.

              <p>
                Covid-19 pandemic has significantly contributed towards the
                augmented reality and virtual reality technology market growth
                since more & more businesses have turned completely into the
                remote. Another reason for Augmented reality and virtual reality
                markets to grow fast will be factors like higher demand for
                smartphone-based augmented reality, growing takeovers and
                company mergers, advanced augmented and virtual reality
                technology, high demand for advanced tools in the entertainment
                sector, and more adoption of AR VR technology in education,
                health care, and retail industries. The augmented reality and
                virtual reality market size stood at approx. $15 billion in 2020
                is projected to grow at a staggering rate of a CAGR 40%. It will
                touch around $450 billion by 2030. Many large enterprises show
                the highest growth in the augmented and virtual reality markets
                and are expected to maintain their dominance in the forthcoming
                years.
